# Speech-to-Text
üß† Speech-to-Text AI Model ‚Äì Built from Scratch Without External APIs
üöÄ I‚Äôm excited to share my latest project ‚Äì a Speech-to-Text deep learning model developed completely from scratch, without using any pre-built APIs or third-party transcription services. This project reflects my commitment to deeply understanding the mechanics of speech recognition, neural architectures, and audio processing.

üìå Project Highlights:
Custom-Built Neural Network: Implemented a model inspired by architectures like DeepSpeech2 using TensorFlow and Keras. It combines convolutional layers, bidirectional RNNs, and a CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) loss function to map audio spectrograms directly to text.

Raw Audio Dataset: Trained the model on publicly available open-source WAV-based datasets like the LJ Speech Dataset, focusing on clean, labeled speech for effective learning.

Preprocessing Pipeline: Developed a complete audio preprocessing pipeline from the ground up, including:

STFT-based spectrogram generation

Audio normalization and augmentation

Phoneme-to-character mapping for vocabulary creation

No APIs Used: The entire transcription pipeline is internally built‚Äîno reliance on external APIs like Google Speech, Azure, or Whisper‚Äîensuring full control over data, model, and inference.

CTC Loss for Alignment-Free Training: Implemented CTC Loss to train the model on unaligned text-audio pairs, allowing for robust learning even when audio lengths vary.

Custom Inference Loop: Created a decoding mechanism to convert model outputs into readable text, managing blank tokens and repetitions as per CTC decoding logic.

üîç Why This Matters:
Most speech-to-text systems today rely heavily on pre-trained APIs, limiting customization, transparency, and learning. By building everything from the ground up, this project:

Deepens my understanding of audio ML pipelines

Gives me full control over model architecture and performance

Enables domain-specific tuning for different accents, languages, or speech patterns in the future

üìÇ Next Steps:
Optimize model for real-time inference

Experiment with beam search decoding

Expand training dataset to improve generalization

Explore speaker adaptation techniques
